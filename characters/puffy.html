                    <p style = "text-align: left;">puffy is a dandelion-like being that just kinda showed
                        up one day. honestly, they're not even sure where they came from themselves.
                        the first bug to make contact puffy was <a href="cleft.html">cleft</a>, who found them wandering around after a rainstorm. 
                        during this encounter, cleft gave them the name puffy. puffy's leaf cloak was handmade by 
                        <a href="lena.html">lena</a> and it's their most treasured possession.<br><br>
                        lacking a mouth, puffy is mute. even so, they're very expressive and easy to read. 
                        while puffy is easily entertained, they're also easily spooked: they only feel 
                        comfortable with cleft or lena and tend to disappear around others.<br><br>
                        puffy enjoys catching a breeze and floating along. it's their preferred method of travel.
                        and unlike an actual dandelion, their puffball head never disperses, no matter how strong the winds get.
