                <p>jackychang.ca is just like wikipedia. we're getting taken offline because we couldn't reach our donation goal...<br><br>

                    but for real, i gotta renew the domain before it expires. as you might imagine, jackychang.ca is a highly contested domain.<br><br>

                    plus, i think i'll get back to work on the site now that a new school semester has begun. i'm actually enrolled in a web dev course right now,
                    so i guess this site was a good use of time after all. it's been good html practice! and i want to add some more features as well. about a month
                    or two ago i was working on revamping the <a href="paintGallery.html">paint gallery</a> page, (who knows, by the time someone reads this, it might already be updated!) but fell
                    off soon after starting. also want to add video support because it'd be funny. look forward to cool videos in future blog posts.<br><br>

                    and! lastly! look forward to more frequent blog posts, for real this time! next up: 2025 in review and the game/movie/album list!

                <p>apologies to all 0 of my daily readers for the inactivity. when i initially set up this blog page i anticipated that i'd
                    be posting frequently. here's an update on the cool things i've been up to since october 13th:<br><br>

                    playing lots of games! back in february i made a list of things i wanted to achieve by the end of the year. among them was
                    listening to 10 new albums, watching 10 new movies, and playing/beating 10 new games. i've defintely reached the album goal and
                    i'm probably close to the game goal, but i think i've only seen something like 5 movies this year. i'll be sure to post the full
                    list when the time comes.<br><br>

                    my fall break started back on the 10th so i've had more opportunities to play different games. but i started using my ps2 for real
                    a few weeks earlier, after i replaced the cmos battery. now the little save icons show the correct dates and times! :)
                    for a few days the only thing i did after coming home from school was playing lumines plus.. that game rocks. even though i've had
                    my ps2 since 2022, i've barely touched any of the games i have for it. it was really fun trying a game out for an hour and
                    then switching it out for another one. i tried out katamari damacy, metal gear solid 2, pac-man world 2, hot shots golf fore, ddr, (which is
                    actually pretty fun even with a controller) jak and daxter, and ridge racer v!! ridge racer v is sooo good that's gotta be one of the most
                    satisfying games to play for real...<br><br>
                    
                    this week, however, i've been playing lots of gamecube games. well, i've been playing lots of two specific gamecube games. kirby air ride and
                    animal crossing! it's nice having a smaller library of games to choose from. it's far less daunting than my endless digital library on steam.
                    something i've really been wanting to make on this site since i created the blog section is a subpage called "game log" or something, where i'll
                    talk in more detail about a game i've been playing. it would also tie back to the "play 10 new games this year" thing and help me keep track of
                    said games. anyways, that's probably enough for one blog post. kinda lacked focus, but so what? that's the whole
                    point of this page, and to a greater extent, this whole site! just typing stuff for fun. see you in the next post.

                <p>it's time!! after about two weeks, (has it really been that long..?) the character page update is finally here!
                    it's not like i've been working on it for two weeks straight, (it <i>is</i> midterm season) but it's definitely
                    had a lot of effort put into it! (in particular, the 'convos' section took a while. each one's scope grew bigger
                    than the last..! knowing this, maybe you can even determine the order in which they were created..)<br><br>
                    
                    if you're interested, go check it out and read all the cool things over there!
                    you can use one of the many links to it that exist on the site, like <a href="characterPage.html">this one</a>,

                <div class="divider">01: cool songs</div>
                <p>now that the site's been fully re-written, i thought it'd be fun to share some cool songs i've been listening to lately. keep in mind that i'm not a music
                reviewer by any means so don't be expecting in-depth write-ups.<br> <br>
                <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/50PqkVcHBP1zi3USIRtooK?si=d9195ca629454f8f" target="blank">Chubby</a>
                <span style="color:gray"><small>Pitcher56 - Pitcher56 1st Album</small></span><br>
                after not putting out any new music in over a decade, Pitcher56 came back in 2022 with the (aptly..?)
                titled 'Pitcher56 1st Album' and this opening track is so good. the piano is my favourite instrument
                and it sounds great here.<br><br>

                <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/1s16yZ0cyNAJJT1iUVMwam?si=3ce894e9cbc341a4" target="blank">If You Want It</a>
                <span style="color:gray"><small>Niteflyte - Niteflyte</small></span><br>
                the guitar in the opening to this one seriously reminded me of 'Sparkle' by Tatsuro Yamashita, one of my
                all-time favourite songs + artists. if you can find an upload somewhere, i urge you to take a listen. as for 'If You Want It,'
                the strings are really nice and the vocals are amazing. plus, the hook <cite>"if you want it, you can get it, with your love"</cite>
                is super catchy.<br><br>

                <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/2WxzLbJfPA2vJGxQiKd7Jq?si=8144865e71b0431e" target="blank">Fine Whine (feat. Joe Fox, Future & M.I.A.)</a>
                <span style="color:gray"><small>A$AP Rocky - AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP</small></span><br>
                yet again, im a sucker for piano. i adore Rocky's experimental production, especially on his 2018 album 'TESTING.'
                i must've listened to this song on repeat a dozen times yesterday while drawing.<br><br>

                <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/track/50UymqLGnRL10EA2CttJh2?si=7d19ae285c824b02" target="blank">Bubbles</a>
                <span style="color:gray"><small>jenny01 - jenny01 Best</small></span><br>
                this song shares a lot of vibes with 'Chubby.' 1:40 rocks, especially with headphones on. very cheerful-sounding song
                all around. this is the type of music i'd like to make someday. :)

                <div class="divider">00: making a website</div>
                <p>the first (of likely many) blog posts! at the time of writing, the blog is still being implemented so i'm not sure when this'll go up.
                    making this website is a learning experience. <br> <br>for example, the way things work right now, the whole blog page format breaks depending
                    on the length of certain pieces of text. it's hard to describe properly. it's a miracle everything else (mostly) works lol
                </p>
                <p style="color:gray"><small>later...</small></p>
                <p>i figured out what's making everything break. no clue how to fix it though. basically, if a blog post doesn't have enough text to fill
                    its default width, (i.e. enough text so that it goes onto a second line) then it tries to cram two elements next to each other.</p>
